            <p>My name is Alice. I started my career in the healthcare field and worked mainly with healthcare agency managements on the back end and was also working as a dental assistant on the side. I've found that I wanted a career change and so I turned to coding. I'm currently learning to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and hope to improve my skills as I go on. In my spare time I enjoy playing with my dog and cats and watching videos on the internet.</p>
